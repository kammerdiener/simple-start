# Simple Start
This is meant to be something to help you get up and going quickly

**All of the code in this repo is use at your own risk. I maintain no responsibility for issues.**
But if you do run into an issue. Fix it and submit a PR :D

## Basic Ideas
This is meant to have some simple little snippets that are continually kept updated. Hoping to make it easier to continually be building.

If you see something wrong or just think of a snippet that would be great to add be sure to submit a PR (If you do I will add you to the Contributors section :D)
